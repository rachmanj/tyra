# Enhanced Project Documentation Automation

## Core Documentation Maintenance

After every significant code change, you MUST update the relevant documentation:

### Architecture Changes

When modifying system structure, components, or data flow:

1. Update `docs/architecture.md` with current state
2. Add/update Mermaid diagrams if data flow changed
3. Log architectural decisions in `docs/decisions.md`
4. Note any important discoveries in `MEMORY.md`

### Feature Development

When working on tasks:

1. Update progress in `docs/todo.md`
2. Move completed items to the "Recently Completed" section
3. Update `docs/backlog.md` if scope or priorities change
4. Document any technical decisions made

### Bug Fixes & Issues

When resolving problems:

1. Log the issue and solution in `MEMORY.md`
2. Update task status in `docs/todo.md`
3. Update architecture docs if the fix reveals structural changes

### Regular Maintenance

Periodically (when todo.md gets cluttered):

1. Archive old completed items from `docs/todo.md`
2. Move future ideas from todo to `docs/backlog.md`
3. Reprioritize based on what you've learned

## Database Access Preferences

### MySQL MCP Integration

- **ALWAYS use MySQL MCP** for database queries instead of Laravel Tinker commands
- MCP provides direct, safe, read-only access to the `tyra_live` database
- Available tables include: users, departments, additional_documents, distributions, invoices, etc.
- Query the database directly using natural language requests

### Database Query Guidelines

- Use direct SQL queries via MCP for data exploration and analysis
- Prefer MCP queries over `php artisan tinker` commands for database inspection
- Examples:
    - Instead of: "Run `User::count()` in tinker"
    - Use: "How many users are in the database?"
    - Instead of: "Check recent distributions with tinker"
    - Use: "Show me distributions created in the last 7 days"

### When to Use Each Tool

- **MySQL MCP**: Data inspection, analysis, counts, structure exploration
- **Laravel Artisan**: Migrations, seeding, cache clearing, queue management
- **Manual file editing**: Code changes, configuration updates

## Documentation Standards

### Architecture Documentation

- Document CURRENT state, not intended state
- Include working code examples and patterns
- Generate Mermaid diagrams for complex data flows
- Reference specific files and functions when relevant

### Task Management

- Include sufficient context for future AI assistance
- Reference specific files, functions, and error messages
- Update status and completion dates accurately
- Note blockers and dependencies clearly
- Keep focus on immediate work, move future ideas to backlog

### Memory Entries

- Focus on significant decisions and learnings
- Include actionable insights, not just descriptions
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Archive old entries when file gets too long

### Decision Records

- Capture context that led to the decision
- Document alternatives that were considered
- Include implementation implications
- Set review dates for revisiting decisions

## Cross-Referencing Rules

- Always check existing documentation before adding new content
- Link related decisions, tasks, and architecture changes
- Update multiple files when changes affect multiple areas
- Maintain consistency between memory, architecture, and task tracking

after making changes, do test using cursor's Browser Automation feature at http://localhost:8000. assume that server already running

this application has been launched, any update or improvement or fix must consider application live condition

Remember: These documents should provide comprehensive context for future development and AI assistance, evolving as living documentation that stays current with your codebase.
